I store entire tarballs here that pristine-tar currently fails to
reproduce, and the Makefile tests them. I don't want to lose track of any
negative test cases like these. Perhaps in the future, this can also be
used as a regression test suite..

The testexternal target can be called to test a set of externally-provided
tarballs. I use this to test against the entire Debian source archive, etc.
